# Adaptive Itinerary Generation Requirements

## Introduction

The current itinerary generation system fails with 404 errors when users select larger search radii or search in areas with fewer places. This feature will implement adaptive algorithms that adjust generation parameters based on available places and search context to provide a better user experience across different location densities and search preferences.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dynamic Distance Constraint Adaptation

**User Story:** As a user searching in rural or sparse areas, I want the system to adapt its walking distance requirements so I can still get itineraries even when places are further apart.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the search radius is greater than 2 miles THEN the system SHALL increase the maximum walking distance constraint from 0.7 miles to 1.0 miles
2. WHEN fewer than 15 total places are found THEN the system SHALL relax the compliance rate from 75% to 60%
3. WHEN the search radius is 3+ miles THEN the system SHALL allow walking distances up to 1.2 miles between stops
4. IF no itineraries can be created with standard constraints THEN the system SHALL progressively relax constraints until at least one itinerary is possible

### Requirement 2: Minimum Place Threshold Adjustment

**User Story:** As a user in a small town or rural area, I want to get itineraries even when there are fewer places available, so I don't get error messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fewer than 10 total places are found THEN the system SHALL reduce minimum itinerary size from 3 places to 2 places
2. WHEN fewer than 6 total places are found THEN the system SHALL allow single-stop "micro-itineraries" with extended descriptions
3. WHEN no places are found in a category THEN the system SHALL substitute with the closest available category
4. IF total places found is less than 3 THEN the system SHALL return a helpful message suggesting nearby larger cities instead of a 404 error

### Requirement 3: Intelligent Fallback Strategies

**User Story:** As a user who gets no results, I want the system to suggest alternative approaches rather than just showing an error, so I can still find something to do.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN itinerary generation fails THEN the system SHALL suggest reducing the search radius
2. WHEN itinerary generation fails THEN the system SHALL suggest nearby larger cities or areas
3. WHEN specific preset categories have no results THEN the system SHALL offer mixed category alternatives
4. WHEN no results are found THEN the system SHALL provide actionable suggestions in the error message

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Error Messages and User Guidance

**User Story:** As a user who encounters generation failures, I want clear, helpful error messages that guide me toward successful searches rather than generic error text.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN insufficient places are found THEN the system SHALL show the number of places found and suggest optimal search radius
2. WHEN distance constraints cannot be met THEN the system SHALL explain the walking distance limitations and suggest alternatives
3. WHEN preset categories fail THEN the system SHALL suggest which categories have available places
4. WHEN location cannot be found THEN the system SHALL suggest spelling corrections or nearby alternatives

### Requirement 5: Search Radius Optimization Recommendations

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to recommend optimal search radii based on my location type so I get the best results without trial and error.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user searches in an urban area THEN the system SHALL recommend 1-2 mile radius for optimal results
2. WHEN a user searches in a suburban area THEN the system SHALL recommend 2-3 mile radius
3. WHEN a user searches in a rural area THEN the system SHALL recommend 3-5 mile radius or suggest nearby cities
4. WHEN the current search radius yields poor results THEN the system SHALL suggest an optimal radius in the response

### Requirement 6: Progressive Constraint Relaxation

**User Story:** As a system, I want to progressively relax generation constraints when standard parameters fail, so users always get some form of useful results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN standard constraints fail THEN the system SHALL try with 60% compliance rate
2. WHEN 60% compliance fails THEN the system SHALL try with 40% compliance rate
3. WHEN compliance-based generation fails THEN the system SHALL generate distance-optimized itineraries regardless of strict compliance
4. WHEN all generation methods fail THEN the system SHALL return a curated list of individual places with travel suggestions
