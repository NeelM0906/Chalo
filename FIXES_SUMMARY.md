# LocalWander Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ✅ Increased Search Distance & Result Saving
- **Changed**: Search radius from 1.5 miles to 2.5 miles (`SEARCH_RADIUS_METERS = 4023`)
- **Added**: Itinerary filtering to keep final stops within 1.5 miles (`ITINERARY_RADIUS_METERS = 2414`)
- **Added**: Automatic saving of all search results to `backend/search_results/` folder
- **Added**: Timestamped JSON files for easy review

### 2. ✅ Fixed Mixed Results Issue
- **Rewrote**: `create_mixed_itinerary()` method to force true diversity
- **Added**: Broad type counting with maximum 2 places per type
- **Added**: Two-pass selection (first pass: one of each type, second pass: fill remaining)
- **Added**: Debug logging to verify mixed results
- **Fixed**: Places now properly filtered to itinerary radius

### 3. ✅ Fixed Refresh Button with Cached Results
- **Added**: Global `search_results_cache` to store search results
- **Changed**: Refresh functionality now uses cached results (no new API calls)
- **Added**: Smart selection from top 5 alternatives for variety
- **Fixed**: Category matching logic for better alternatives

### 4. ✅ Reduced API Call Volume
- **Added**: 1-hour result caching system
- **Reduced**: Concurrent workers from 5 to 3
- **Increased**: Rate limiting delays from 0.3s to 0.5s
- **Added**: Cache key generation and management
- **Added**: Automatic cache cleanup

## New Features:

### Result Caching System
- Results cached for 1 hour in `backend/cache/` folder
- Automatic cache key generation based on location + categories
- Cache validation and cleanup

### Search Results Saving
- All search results automatically saved to JSON files
- Files named with location and timestamp
- Easy to review and analyze search patterns

### Improved Mixed Itineraries
- True diversity across categories (nature, culture, food, shopping)
- Smart food placement in middle positions
- Better category distribution

### No-API-Call Refresh
- Refresh uses cached search results
- No additional API calls when refreshing spots
- Variety in alternatives (not always the top-rated)

## File Changes:

### Backend Files Modified:
- `backend/localwander_engine.py` - Search radius, caching, result saving
- `backend/itinerary_generator.py` - Mixed itinerary logic, diversity enforcement
- `backend/main.py` - Global cache, refresh endpoint fix

### Frontend Files Modified:
- `frontend/src/services/apiService.ts` - Refresh endpoint URL fix

### New Directories Created:
- `backend/cache/` - For caching search results
- `backend/search_results/` - For saving search results for review

## Usage:

1. **Start Backend**: `./start-backend.sh`
2. **Start Frontend**: `./start-frontend.sh`
3. **Search**: Enter any location to get mixed itineraries
4. **Review Results**: Check `backend/search_results/` for JSON files
5. **Refresh Spots**: Click refresh button on any spot (uses cached results)

## API Call Reduction:

- **Before**: ~50-100 API calls per search
- **After**: ~30-50 API calls per search (first time), 0 calls (cached)
- **Refresh**: 0 additional API calls (uses cache)
- **Caching**: Results reused for 1 hour

## Expected Behavior:

1. **Mixed Itineraries**: Each itinerary will have diverse place types
2. **Larger Search Area**: More places to choose from (2.5 mile search)
3. **Focused Final Results**: All stops within 1.5 miles of each other
4. **Working Refresh**: Click refresh to get alternatives from cached results
5. **Saved Results**: JSON files for every search in `search_results/` folder
